## **Team Principles**

A list of core principles guiding the project and the teams workload:

> 1.	Respect for one another: Basically respect each others time, private lives, deadlines etc. If we cannot attend meetings etc., just try and communicate that.

"Our team has beem hired by a climate change NGO to develop an application to track, analyse and provide insights regarding CO2 emissions by the aviation industry"


## **Project Scope**

Built in Python using the Flask/Django framework etc.


> 1.	Django:  Django project backend by a relational database to create a website that allows users to track, calculate and analyse data records CO2 emissions by the aviation industry.
> 2.	Backend: Python
> 3.    Frontend: HTML

## **UX** 

Here's how are App looks ..
